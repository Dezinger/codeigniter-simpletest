# CodeIgniter with SimpleTest

This has been adopted from:
<http://jamieonsoftware.com/blog/entry/setting-up-the-perfect-codeigniter-tdd-environment>

# Installation

The unit_test.php file should go in your CodeIgniter root. The same place as index.php

You should open that file and alter your paths. 

The tests directory can be moved any where you want but they are setup to be in the root as well. 

I have included a full download of simpletest and the only customization I have made is to the `simpletest/extensions/my_reporter.php`
